##A Ruby on Rails-based todo list

A Ruby on Rails project to control todos with various areas of focus.

Project to contain:

* List of todos **(Done)**
* Todo section (area of focus) **(Done)**
* Create, show, update/edit and delete of todos **(Done)**
* Sign in capability to enable different users to have different lists. **(Done)**
* Date/time created and completed **(Created done)**
* Todo completion option, formatting the todo with a strikethrough and greyed out - as well as displaying the date and time completed.
* Sort-by (content, section, date created/completed)
* Clear completed todos that does not alter incomplete todos.

Need to do:
* Have completed todos marked as complete - greyed out with a strikethrough, show, edit, complete, delete buttons removed and a clear button to be shown.

The project was originally created to manage my daily tasks at work that required many small tasks across several different areas, some of which would otherwise be forgotten and neglected if not listed in a single manageable location.

Also meant to be practice for building and maintaining a Ruby on Rails CRUD project.
