    %p This project is designed to maintain a list daily/weekly/etc. tasks with control over what features in the list. The design is meant to be simple, where tasks can be created and marked complete once they are done.
    %p In the future, there will be an option to export data from completed tasks into a CSV file - this can be used to show off how hard you work when everyone thinks you just loaf around and surf the net all day.
    %p With this to-do list (once it's done at least...) you can surf the net all day AND pretend you're a hard worker by providing your boss with a report on all the work you've 'done'.
    %p More features coming soon!
    %sub PS. Don't lose your password just yet, you won't be able to get it back until I've set up the functionality... Sorry!
